Beaver and Steve Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to my other favorite web comics, I originally followed up with [Okay Pants](http://web.archive.org/web/20070620013447/http://www.okaypants.com/comic.php) and [KinokoFry](http://kinokofry.com) and got them to work, so I've now expanded it to [Beaver and Steve](http://beaverandsteve.com).

Each chapter is created every 25 comics and loaded into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for my favorite webcomic.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getBeaverAndSteve.rb`
  - Enjoy all of Beaver And Steve!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Beaver and Steve from 2004-2008, when James Turner took and indefinite Beaver and Steve hiatus. :: sniffle ::
